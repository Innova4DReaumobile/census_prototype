Census v0.1.1
=============
A library that calculates useful social metrics from a social graph, using Neo4j and written in Scala.

Features
--------
* Compatible with the JVM.
* Degree centrality metric calculation.
* Betweenness centrality metric calculation.
* Closeness centrality metric calculation.
* Graph snapshots for efficient global centralities calculation and records over time. 

Assembly the .jar
-----------------
To create a packaged jar just run this command in the root dorectory:

```bash
cd path/to/census
sbt assembly 
``` 

The .jar will be created in `path/to/census/target/scala-2.10/census-vX.X.jar`.

How to use
----------
_Note: Normally you will need to calculate this social metrics globaly (for all nodes), in that case you should use the Snapshot feature._

First import the api package.

```java
import edu.udlap.census.CensusAPI;
```

Then instantiate the api. The constructor recieves a string which is the path to where the database will be created.

```java
CensusAPI api = new CensusAPI("target/testdb");
```

### api.insertPerson (id: String, name: String) -> void
Inserts a person with specified id and name into the graph database.

### api.relatePersons (aid: String, bid: String) -> void
Relates two persons with specified ids.

### api.degreeOf (id: String) -> float
Calculates the relative degree centrality of a node with the specified id.

### api.betweennessOf (id: String) -> float
Calculates the betweenness centrality of a node with the specified id.

### api.closenessOf (id: String) -> float
Calculates the closeness centrality of a node with the specified id.

Graph Snapshot
--------------
A graph snapshot is a recorded state of a graph at any time, when created it calculates the 3 centralities and all shortest paths for ALL the nodes in the graph, it is useful because it is more efficient overall and you can have a record of change.

_Note: a snapshot calculates the **relative** betweenness and degree of the nodes, which should be a much more useful measure._

### How to use the Snapshot Feature

First import the Snapshot and Graph classes.

```java
import edu.udlap.graph.Graph;
import edu.udlap.graph.Snapshot;
```

Then create a graph.

```java
Graph graph = new Graph("path/to/the/graph/db");
```

After that add some persons to the graph and relate them.

```java
graph.insertPerson("ID01", "Franco");
graph.insertPerson("ID02", "Francisco");
graph.relatePersons("ID01", "ID02");
```

Then create a snapshot with the graph.

```java
Snapshot snapshot = new Snapshot(graph);
```

Depending on how many nodes the calculation of the 3 centralities on ALL nodes could take some time; after that time is finished you can access to the data through the centralities caches or though the centrality methods.

```java
graph.degreeOf("ID01");
graph.betweennessOf("ID01");
graph.closenessOf("ID01");
```

### Attributes of a Snapshot object

#### n
The number of nodes in the graph.

#### ids
A List of all the ids in the graph.

#### timestamp
A `System.currentTimeMillis` record of the snapshot.

#### shortestPaths
A `Map <String, List <List <String>>>` with all the shortest paths between all nodes. They key is in the form `<id1>-<id2>`. 

#### degreeCache
A `Map <String, Float>` with all the degree centralities. The key is in the form `<node-id>`, for example: 

```java
float francosDegree = snapshot.degreeCache.get("ID01");
```

#### betweennessCache
A `Map <String, Float>` with all the betweenness centralities.

#### closenessCache
A `Map <String, Float>` with all the closeness centralities.

### Methods of a Snapshot object

#### snapshot.degreeOf (id: String) -> float
Retrieves the relative degree centrality of a node with the specified id.

#### snapshot.betweennessOf (id: String) -> float
Retrieves the relative betweenness centrality of a node with the specified id.

#### snapshot.closenessOf (id: String) -> float
Retrieves the closeness centrality of a node with the specified id.

TODO
----
* Parallelize the shortest paths computation for the snapshot.
